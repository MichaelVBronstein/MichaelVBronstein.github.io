- title: "When negative interpretations persist, positive emotions don't! Inflexible negative interpretations encourage depression and social anxiety by dampening positive emotions"
  image: TBG_ARPES.png
  description: Research on emotion regulation difficulties has been instrumental in understanding hallmark features of de- pression and social anxiety. Yet, the cognitive mechanisms that give rise to maladaptive patterns of emotion regulation strategy use remain underspecified. This investigation examined the association of negative inter- pretation inflexibility and interpretation biases with the use of common emotion regulation strategies in response to negative and positive emotional experiences (repetitive negative thinking, positive reappraisal, and dampening). Study 1 (N=250) found that inflexibility in revising negative interpretations in response to dis- confirmatory positive information was related to the dampening of positive emotions, but not to repetitive negative thinking or positive reappraisal. Importantly, dampening mediated the relation between inflexible negative interpretations and symptoms of both depression and social anxiety. This mediation model was further supported by the data from Study 2 (N=294). Across both studies, negative interpretation bias was related to repetitive negative thinking and dampening, whereas positive interpretation bias was related to positive re- appraisal. Collectively, these results suggest that both interpretation inflexibility and interpretation biases may contribute to difficulties in emotion regulation related to depression and social anxiety.

- title: "Belief in fake news is associated with delusionality, dogmatism, religious fundamentalism, and reduced analytic thinking"
  image: TBG_ARPES.png
  description: Delusion-prone individuals may be more likely to accept even delusion-irrelevant implausible ideas because of their tendency to engage in less analytic and less actively open-minded thinking. Consistent with this suggestion, two online studies with over 900 participants demonstrated that although delusion-prone individuals were no more likely to believe true news headlines, they displayed an increased belief in “fake news” headlines, which often feature implausible content. Mediation analyses suggest that analytic cognitive style may partially explain these individuals’ increased willingness to believe fake news. Exploratory analyses showed that dogmatic individuals and religious fundamentalists were also more likely to believe false (but not true) news, and that these relationships may be fully explained by analytic cognitive style. Our findings suggest that existing interventions that increase analytic and actively open-minded thinking might be leveraged to help reduce belief in fake news.

- title: "Pathways to paranoia: Analytic thinking and belief flexibility"
  image: TBG_ARPES.png
  description: Delusions have been repeatedly linked to reduced engagement in analytic (i.e., conscious and effortful) reasoning. However, the mechanisms underlying this relationship remain unclear. One hypothesis is that less analytic reasoning might maintain persecutory delusions by reducing belief flexibility. An important aspect of belief flexibility is the ability to revise beliefs in response to disconfirmatory evidence. The present study recruited 231 participants from the general population that represented a wide range of paranoid ideation. Participants completed tasks in which they encountered a series of ambiguous scenarios with initially-appealing explanations that were later disconfirmed by statements supporting alternative interpretations. Three types of scenarios were employed. Two presented participants with emotionally valenced explanations (i.e., negative or positive) and one presented participants with emotionally neutral explanations. In each type of reasoning scenario, impaired belief revision ability was found to partially mediate the relationship between reduced engagement in analytic reasoning and persecutory ideation. These results are consistent with the notion that reduced engagement in analytic reasoning may help maintain paranoid delusions by interfering with the ability to revise beliefs in the presence of disconfirmatory information.

- title: "Dual-process theory, conflict processing, and delusional belief"
  image: STS_news.png
  description: Many reasoning biases that may contribute to delusion formation and/or maintenance are common in healthy individuals. Research indicating that reasoning in the general population proceeds via analytic processes (which depend upon working memory and support hypothetical thought) and intuitive processes (which are autonomous and independent of working memory) may therefore help uncover the source of these biases. Consistent with this possibility, recent studies imply that impaired conflict processing might reduce engagement in analytic reasoning, thereby producing reasoning biases and promoting delusions in individuals with schizophrenia. Progress toward understanding this potential pathway to delusions is currently impeded by ambiguity about whether any of these deficits or biases is necessary or sufficient for the formation and maintenance of delusions. Resolving this ambiguity requires consideration of whether particular cognitive deficits or biases in this putative pathway have causal primacy over other processes that may also participate in the causation of delusions. Accordingly, the present manuscript critically evaluates whether impaired conflict processing is the primary initiating deficit in the generation of reasoning biases that may promote the development and/or maintenance of delusions. Suggestions for future research that may elucidate mechanistic pathways by which reasoning deficits might engender and maintain delusions are subsequently offered.

- title: "Looking through tinted glasses: Depression and social anxiety are related to both interpretation biases and inflexible negative interpretations"
  image: PbSpub.png
  description: Interpretation bias is often theorized to play a critical role in depression and social anxiety. To date, it remains unknown how interpretation bias exerts its toxic effects. Interpretation inflexibility may be an important determinant of how distorted interpretations affect emotional well-being. This study investigated interpretation bias and inflexibility in relation to depression severity and social anxiety. Participants (N=212) completed a novel cognitive task which simultaneously measured bias and inflexibility in the interpretation of unfolding ambiguous situations. Depression severity was associated with increased negative and decreased positive interpretation biases. Social anxiety was associated with increased negative interpretation bias. Critically, both symptom types were related to reduced revision of negative interpretations by disconfirmatory positive information. These findings suggest that individuals with more severe depression or social anxiety make more biased and inflexible interpretations. Future work examining cognitive risk for depression and anxiety could benefit from examining both these factors.

- title: "Measuring bias against disconfirmatory evidence: An evaluation of BADE task scoring methods and the case for a novel method"
  image: DomePub.png
  description: Research suggests that bias against disconfirmatory evidence (BADE) may help maintain delusions in the face of overwhelming evidence against them. Much of this research has employed Woodward and colleagues’ BADE task. Different methods of scoring this task, many of which have significant drawbacks, are currently used by researchers, making it difficult to compare results across studies of BADE. Continued advancement of BADE research demands a scoring method with more favorable psychometric properties that is used more consistently by researchers. Here, we take a data-driven but theory-informed approach to the development of a new method for scoring the BADE task. This new scoring procedure is more parsimonious than previous metrics of BADE but captures the vast majority of their predictive variance in relation to delusions. This new method may therefore be capable of inspiring consensus use among BADE researchers. If so, it could significantly increase the ease of comparing future studies of BADE.

- title: "Mistiming of thought and perception predicts delusionality"
  image: Pub_BCl.png
  description: The nature and origin of delusional belief in illnesses like schizophrenia has been an active topic of research for decades. Yet relatively less work has been devoted to relating this high-level phenomenon to lower-level perceptual mechanisms. We consider whether an illusory reversal in the perception of when a prediction and observation occur in time predicts the presence of delusion-like ideation. We find evidence for such a relationship, suggesting that specific perceptual deficits in how people experience the timing of their thoughts might be a contributor to delusionality. Detecting these perceptual abnormalities early on may therefore prove fruitful for understanding, diagnosing, and treating certain forms of mental illness.

- title: "Both bias against disconfirmatory evidence and political orientation partially explain the relationship between dogmatism and racial prejudice"
  image: Fano.png
  description: Dogmatism and prejudice are strongly related. We hypothesized that bias against disconfirmatory evidence (BADE) might explain a portion of this relationship unique from that explained by constructs including Political Orientation. BADE (measured by the BADE task) comprises two facets, Evidence Integration Impairment and Positive Response Bias. Only Evidence Integration Impairment was expected to partially explain the prejudice-dogmatism relationship because in prior research it alone was associated with group differences in inflexible beliefs. 254 MTurk participants completed measures of dogmatism, racial prejudice, BADE (Evidence Integration Impairment and Positive Response Bias), and Political Orientation. The hypothesized mediation effect was examined using a bootstrapping procedure. Dogmatism predicted racial prejudice [b = 0.24, t(249) = 4.92, p < .001]; this relationship weakened in the presence of the above measures [b = 0.05, t(246) = 0.91, p = .363]. The 95% confidence interval for the size of the indirect effect of dogmatism on racial prejudice via Evidence Integration Impairment did not include zero [0.151, 0.331], confirming the hypothesized mediation effect. Evidence Integration Impairment accounts for a unique portion of the relationship between dogmatism and racial prejudice, suggesting that belief revision failures in ambiguous social situations may support prejudice in dogmatic individuals.

- title: "Bias Against Disconfirmatory Evidence in a large Nonclinical Sample: Associations with Schizotypy and Delusional Beliefs"
  image: SmartPub.png
  description: Bias against disconfirmatory evidence (BADE) is associated with delusion-like ideation and delusion-related aspects of schizotypy in nonclinical populations. Using a well-validated BADE assessment, we sought to demonstrate that only one of two facets of BADE (Evidence Integration Impairment, but not Positive Response Bias) accounts for these associations. To this end, 738 MTurk participants completed a survey which included the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ) and a version of the aforementioned BADE assessment. Using multiple regression, it was found that only Evidence Integration Impairment accounted for unique variance in delusion-related SPQ subscale scores. These results suggest, consistent with our hypothesis, that Evidence Integration Impairment might solely account for previously observed associations between BADE more generally and various cognitions/personality traits.  It follows from this suggestion that in the general population ambiguous situations may combine with cognitive biases to maintain delusion-like ideation.
