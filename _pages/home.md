# About Me

Humans believe a plethora of things that are not true. In the general population, this tendency reduces vaccination rates and encourages violence. It also plays a role in multiple psychopathologies, including depression, schizophrenia, and anorexia. My research uses data science methods -- including causal and predictive machine learning -- to elucidate cognitive and affective pathways that
create and maintain discrepancies between beliefs and reality. I began this work at Yale, where I received my Ph.D. in Psychology, and have continued it as a professor in psychiatry and health informatics at the University of Minnesota. Hypotheses Tested. Data Analyzed. Insights Communicated. Beliefs Revised.
