Armed with strong research, data analysis, and programming skills, my professional goal is to create a world where the deleterious effects of fixed, false beliefs are minimized.

I am currently working toward this goal by conducting research meant to better specify cognitive pathways that create and maintain discrepancies between beliefs and reality, thereby providing knowledge critical for the development of more effective cognitive-behavioral interventions for individuals with psychosis and/or depression. My interest in psychopathology stems from the fact that it is replete with examples of complex nomothetical spaces that have been segmented according to theories that may not explicitly compete with one another and are rarely studied in tandem. I work to resolve the causal structure of these spaces by bringing constructs from different cognitive theories of psychopathology (as well as those from “pure” cognitive psychology) into conversation with one another. With regard to particular research questions, I am fascinated by the fact that people frequently believe things that are not true, and often continue to believe these things in the face of evidence against them. This is true of multiple clinical populations --- people with psychosis who believe delusions, people from the general population who believe fake news, people who endorse suicidal ideation and see themselves incorrectly as a burden to others. Elucidating the cognitive basis of this tendency, as well as its effects on outcomes related to mental health, in humans, is likely to have implications for efforts to improve task performance as well as the human experience more broadly.
